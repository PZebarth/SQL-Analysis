# SQL-Analysis

## Project Motivation

This project will pull data from different databases and use the information to identify trends in deforestation. I wanted to see for myself how deforestation is different in other parts of the world or varies from country to country. <br>

## File Description:

Project #1.sql: contains all the queries needed to run on the databases <br>
forest_area.csv:  contains data on country code, country name,	year,	forest area sqkm <br>
land_area.csv: contains data on country code, country name,	year,	total area sqmi <br>
regions.csv: contains data on country name,	country code,	region,	income group <br>

## Results:
The results of the queries for this project are documented within: Deforestation Exploration.pdf <br>
